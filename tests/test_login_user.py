<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To verify that the Reqres API can login a user using a POST request, and that the response code and content are valid and accurate.</p>

<h2>Preconditions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Reqres API is available and accessible.</li>
  <li>Test data is available for logging in a registered user.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Send a POST request to the endpoint for logging in a user using the Reqres API, including valid test data in the request body.</li>
  <li>Verify that the response code returned is <code>200 OK</code>, indicating that the request was successful.</li>
  <li>Verify that the response content returned is in JSON format.</li>
  <li>Verify that the response content contains the expected <code>token</code> property.</li>
</ol>
