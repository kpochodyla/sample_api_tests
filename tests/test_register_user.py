  <h1>Test Scenario: Register user with POST Request</h1>
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>To verify that the Reqres API can create a new user using a POST request, and that the response code and content are valid and accurate.</p>
  <h2>Preconditions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Reqres API is available and accessible.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Test Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Send a POST request to the endpoint for registering a user using the Reqres API, including the test data in the request body.</li>
    <li>Verify that the response code returned is <code>200 OK</code>, indicating that the request was successful.</li>
    <li>Verify that the response content returned is in JSON format.</li>
    <li>Verify that the the response contains the expected properties, such as <code>id</code> and <code>token</code>,</li>
    <li>Verify that the values of the <code>id</code> property in the response is accurate and match the test data in the request.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Expected Result</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The POST request to register a new user should return a response code of <code>200 OK</code>.</li>
    <li>The response content should be in JSON format and contain the expected data for the registered user.</li>
    <li>The data in the response should contain the expected properties and accurate values.</li>
