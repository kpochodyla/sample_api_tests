<h1>Test Scenario: Retrieve Single User by ID with GET Request</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>To verify that the Reqres API can retrieve a single user by ID using a GET request, and that the response code and content are valid and accurate.</p>

<h2>Preconditions</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Reqres API is available and accessible.</li>
<li>Test data is available in the Reqres API for retrieving a single user by ID.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Send a GET request to the endpoint for retrieving a single user by ID using the Reqres API, specifying a valid user ID.</li>
<li>Verify that the response code returned is <code>200 OK</code>, indicating that the request was successful.</li>
<li>Verify that the response content returned is in JSON format.</li>
<li>Verify that the response content contains the expected user object.</li>
<li>Verify that the user object in the response contains the expected properties, such as <code>id</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>avatar</code>.</li>
<li>Verify that the values of the properties in the user object are accurate and match the test data in the Reqres API.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Expected Result</h2>

<ul>
<li>The GET request to retrieve a single user by ID should return a response code of <code>200 OK</code>.</li>
<li>The response content should be in JSON format and contain the expected user object.</li>
<li>The user object in the response should contain the expected properties and accurate values.</li>
</ul>
