<h1>Test Scenario: Retrieve List of Users with GET Request</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>To verify that the Reqres API can retrieve a list of users using a GET request, and that the response code and content are valid and accurate.</p>

<h2>Preconditions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The Reqres API is available and accessible.</li>
    <li>Test data is available in the Reqres API for retrieving a list of users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Test Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Send a GET request to the endpoint for retrieving a list of users using the Reqres API.</li>
    <li>Verify that the response code returned is <code>200 OK</code>, indicating that the request was successful.</li>
    <li>Verify that the response content returned is in JSON format</li>
    <li>Verify that the response content contains a list of user objects.</li>
    <li>Verify that each user object in the response contains the expected properties, such as <code>id</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>first_name</code>.</li>
    <li>Verify that the values of the properties in each user object are accurate and match the test data in the Reqres API.</li>
    <li>Verify that the response content contains the expected number of user objects, based on the test data in the Reqres API.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Expected Result</h2>

<ul>
    <li>The GET request to retrieve a list of users should return a response code of <code>200 OK</code>.</li>
    <li>The response content should be in JSON format and contain a list of user objects.</li>
    <li>Each user object in the response should contain the expected properties and accurate values.</li>
    <li>The response content should contain the expected number of user objects.</li>
</ul>
