# Test Scenario: Retrieve List of Users with GET Request

## Objective

To verify that the Reqres API can retrieve a list of users using a GET request, and that the response code and content are valid and accurate.

## Preconditions

- The Reqres API is available and accessible.
- Test data is available in the Reqres API for retrieving a list of users.

## Test Steps

1. Send a GET request to the endpoint for retrieving a list of users using the Reqres API.
2. Verify that the response code returned is `200 OK`, indicating that the request was successful.
3. Verify that the response content returned is in JSON format, and contains a list of user objects.
4. Verify that each user object in the response contains the expected properties, such as `id`, `email`, and `first_name`.
5. Verify that the values of the properties in each user object are accurate and match the test data in the Reqres API.
6. Verify that the response content contains the expected number of user objects, based on the test data in the Reqres API.

## Expected Result

- The GET request to retrieve a list of users should return a response code of `200 OK`.
- The response content should be in JSON format and contain a list of user objects.
- Each user object in the response should contain the expected properties and accurate values.
- The response content should contain the expected number of user objects.

Note: Depending on the specific requirements and objectives of the testing project, additional steps and verifications may be necessary.
